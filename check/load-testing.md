To test how many users can concurrently connect to and use your Golang server application, you can perform **load testing** or **stress testing**. There are several tools available to help you simulate concurrent user requests. Here’s a step-by-step guide using some common tools:

### 1. **Using `wrk` (HTTP benchmarking tool)**

`wrk` is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool that can generate significant load, making it useful for stress-testing Go web servers.

#### Installation (on Linux/Mac):
```bash
brew install wrk   # For Mac
sudo apt-get install wrk   # For Ubuntu/Debian
```

#### Usage:

Here’s a basic command to simulate 100 concurrent users sending requests over 30 seconds:

```bash
wrk -t12 -c100 -d30s http://localhost:8080
```

- `-t12`: Number of threads (depending on the CPU).
- `-c100`: Number of concurrent connections (100 users).
- `-d30s`: Duration of the test (30 seconds).
- `http://localhost:8080`: Your Golang server address.

You can tweak these parameters (e.g., increase the number of concurrent connections) to simulate a larger load.

### 2. **Using Apache Benchmark (ab)**

`ab` (Apache Benchmark) is another widely used tool for load testing. It's simpler compared to `wrk` but still very effective.

#### Installation:
On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

On Mac:
```bash
brew install httpd
```

#### Usage:

To simulate 1000 total requests with 100 concurrent users:

```bash
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/
```

- `-n 1000`: Total number of requests.
- `-c 100`: Number of concurrent users.
- `http://localhost:8080/`: Your server's endpoint.

This will show you the request rate, number of successful/failed requests, and response times.

### 3. **Using `k6` (modern load testing tool)**

`k6` is a more developer-centric, scriptable load testing tool that allows for flexible scenarios, including spikes, long-term load, and concurrency.

#### Installation:
```bash
brew install k6  # For Mac
sudo apt-get install k6  # For Ubuntu/Debian
```

#### Usage:

You can create a simple script to simulate multiple users:

**test.js** (a sample `k6` script):

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
    stages: [
        { duration: '30s', target: 50 },   // Simulate ramp-up of traffic to 50 users
        { duration: '1m', target: 50 },    // Stay at 50 users for 1 minute
        { duration: '30s', target: 0 },    // Ramp-down to 0 users
    ],
};

export default function () {
    http.get('http://localhost:8080/');
    sleep(1);
}
```

Run the script:

```bash
k6 run test.js
```

This will simulate the ramp-up, steady state, and ramp-down of concurrent users over time, giving you a more detailed performance report.

### 4. **Using `locust` for User Behavior Simulation**

`locust` is a Python-based tool that allows you to define user behavior and simulate multiple users interacting with your service.

#### Installation:
```bash
pip install locust
```

#### Usage:

Create a Python script that defines user behavior. For example:

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class MyUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)

    @task
    def index(self):
        self.client.get("/")

    @task
    def about(self):
        self.client.get("/about")
```

Run `locust` to simulate users:

```bash
locust -f locustfile.py
```

You can then open `http://localhost:8089` in your browser to start the test and specify the number of users and spawn rate.

### 5. **Monitor System Performance**
While running these tests, it’s important to monitor the server performance (CPU, memory, network) using tools like `htop`, `dstat`, or even profiling your Go server with `pprof` to understand how well it’s handling the load.

### Conclusion
You can start with simpler tools like `wrk` or `ab` to get a rough idea of your Go server's capacity, and later move to more sophisticated tools like `k6` or `locust` for more controlled, detailed load tests. By gradually increasing the load, you can identify bottlenecks and assess how many concurrent users your server can handle.
