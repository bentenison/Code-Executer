To include test inputs and expected outputs directly within the `questions` collection, we can modify the document structure to store this information as part of each question. This allows you to define the test cases along with the question itself, making it easier to manage and execute tests.

### Updated Questions Collection Structure

#### Example Document Structure for `questions`

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "title": "Example Question Title",
  "description": "Describe the problem the user needs to solve.",
  "creator_id": ObjectId("..."), // Reference to the creator (user) who added this question
  "language": "Python", // Programming language for the question
  "created_at": ISODate("2023-10-05T12:00:00Z"),
  "updated_at": ISODate("2023-10-05T12:00:00Z"),
  "difficulty": "Medium", // Difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard)
  "tags": ["array", "string"], // Tags for categorization
  "test_template_id": ObjectId("..."), // Reference to the test template used for this question
  "test_cases": [ // Array of test cases
    {
      "input": "test input 1", // Example input for the test case
      "expected_output": "expected output 1" // Expected output for the given input
    },
    {
      "input": "test input 2",
      "expected_output": "expected output 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of the Fields

- **test_cases:** This field is an array that stores multiple test case objects. Each test case consists of:
  - **input:** The specific input value that the userâ€™s solution will process.
  - **expected_output:** The output that should be produced for the given input.

### Example of a Complete Question Document

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "title": "Sum of Two Numbers",
  "description": "Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.",
  "creator_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "language": "Python",
  "created_at": ISODate("2023-10-05T12:00:00Z"),
  "updated_at": ISODate("2023-10-05T12:00:00Z"),
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "tags": ["math", "addition"],
  "test_template_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "input": "1, 2",
      "expected_output": "3"
    },
    {
      "input": "-1, 1",
      "expected_output": "0"
    },
    {
      "input": "100, 200",
      "expected_output": "300"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits of This Structure

1. **Self-Contained Questions:** Each question contains all the necessary information, including test cases, making it easier to manage and retrieve data.

2. **Ease of Execution:** When executing tests, the relevant inputs and expected outputs can be accessed directly from the question document, streamlining the testing process.

3. **Flexibility:** You can easily add or modify test cases without altering the overall structure of the question.

### Summary

This updated structure for the `questions` collection allows for a comprehensive representation of programming questions, including defined test inputs and expected outputs. This setup facilitates easier management and execution of code tests, enhancing the overall functionality of your code execution platform. Adjust the structure further based on your specific needs!

```{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "template": `
def main(input):
    # User's main logic starts here
    %s
    # User's main logic ends here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_input = "%s" # User input for the test case
    expected_output = "%s" # Expected output
    
    result = main(test_input)
    print("Pass" if result == expected_output else "Fail")
`,
  "language": "Python", // Programming language the template is designed for
  "created_at": ISODate("2023-10-05T12:00:00Z"),
  "updated_at": ISODate("2023-10-05T12:00:00Z"),
