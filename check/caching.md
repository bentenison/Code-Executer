Using Redis for caching in your application can significantly enhance performance. Below, I'll outline a caching strategy using Redis, including examples of what to cache, TTL strategies, and different write strategies (write-through, write-back, and write-ahead).

### Redis Caching Strategy

#### 1. **What to Cache**

You can use Redis to cache the following data structures:

- **Frequently Accessed Questions**
- **Test Templates**
- **User Session Data**
- **Recent Submissions**
- **Configuration Settings**
- **Performance Metrics Aggregates**

#### 2. **TTL Strategies**

- **Short TTL:** For data that changes frequently or is highly dynamic, such as user sessions and recent submissions. A TTL of 5 to 15 minutes can be appropriate.
  
  **Example:**
  ```python
  redis.set('user_session:123', user_session_data, ex=900)  # 15 minutes
  ```

- **Medium TTL:** For data that changes occasionally, like questions and test templates. A TTL of 1 to 6 hours is reasonable.
  
  **Example:**
  ```python
  redis.set('question:456', question_data, ex=21600)  # 6 hours
  ```

- **Long TTL:** For static configuration settings and templates that rarely change, a TTL of days or even weeks can be set.

  **Example:**
  ```python
  redis.set('config:feature_flags', feature_flags_data, ex=604800)  # 7 days
  ```

### 3. **Write Strategies**

Choosing the right write strategy depends on your application needs and how critical data consistency is. Here are three strategies:

#### a. **Write-Through Cache**

In a write-through cache, data is written to the cache and the underlying database simultaneously. This ensures that the cache is always up-to-date.

**Use Case:**
- Suitable for scenarios where immediate consistency between the cache and the database is needed.

**Example:**
```python
def update_question(question_id, question_data):
    # Write to the database
    database.update_question(question_id, question_data)
    
    # Write to the cache
    redis.set(f'question:{question_id}', question_data)
```

#### b. **Write-Back Cache**

In a write-back cache, writes are first made to the cache, and the database is updated asynchronously. This reduces the write load on the database but can risk data loss in case of a cache failure.

**Use Case:**
- Useful for data that can tolerate slight delays in consistency.

**Example:**
```python
def update_question(question_id, question_data):
    # Write to the cache
    redis.set(f'question:{question_id}', question_data)
    
    # Asynchronously write to the database (can use a background worker)
    background_worker.queue_write_to_database(question_id, question_data)
```

#### c. **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**

In a write-ahead strategy, changes are first logged, and then the actual write operation is performed. This can be combined with either of the previous strategies to ensure data integrity.

**Use Case:**
- Suitable for scenarios where data integrity is critical.

**Example:**
```python
def update_question(question_id, question_data):
    # Log the write operation
    redis.lpush('write_ahead_log', (question_id, question_data))
    
    # Write to the cache
    redis.set(f'question:{question_id}', question_data)
    
    # Process the log to write to the database
    process_write_ahead_log()
```

### Summary

By caching frequently accessed data in Redis, implementing appropriate TTL strategies, and choosing a write strategy that fits your application needs, you can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of your code execution platform. 

- **Use Redis for caching:** Frequent reads, user sessions, and configurations.
- **Set appropriate TTLs:** Based on data volatility.
- **Choose a write strategy:** Based on consistency needs and performance considerations.

This setup will help you balance speed, consistency, and reliability effectively.
