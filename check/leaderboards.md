Creating a backend for a **leaderboard** for a **code execution platform** like **HackerRank** in **Go** involves several key components. Below, I'll break it down into steps, outline the architecture, and provide some Go code for relevant parts.

### Key Components for Leaderboard:
1. **User** - Users who participate and submit code.
2. **Challenges** - Coding challenges or problems that users solve.
3. **Submissions** - User submissions for challenges.
4. **Scores** - Based on performance (time, correctness, etc.), users get scores.
5. **Leaderboard** - A dynamic system that ranks users based on their scores.
6. **Database** - A database for storing users, challenges, submissions, and scores.
7. **Caching** - For performance optimization, particularly when fetching leaderboard data.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Database**: Store user profiles, challenges, submissions, scores.
   - **SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)** or **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)** can be used based on the use case.
   
2. **Backend API (Go)**: Handle logic for submitting code, evaluating code, updating scores, and fetching the leaderboard.
   - HTTP API to interact with the frontend.
   - Using **Gin**, **Echo**, or **net/http** to create RESTful APIs.
   
3. **Code Execution**: A sandbox environment to execute code submitted by users securely.
   - Could use **Docker** or **Kubernetes** to isolate the execution environment.
   
4. **Leaderboard Calculation**:
   - Score Calculation: Based on **time**, **accuracy**, **difficulty**, **penalty** points.
   - Real-time updates for leaderboard: Update scores every time a user completes a challenge.

5. **Caching (Optional)**: 
   - Use caching to handle the leaderboard fetching speed. You can use **Redis** to cache leaderboard data and prevent repeated expensive queries.

### 1. **Database Design**
Here’s a simple structure for MongoDB or SQL.

#### Users Collection (or Table)
```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "last_active": "2024-01-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Challenges Collection (or Table)
```json
{
  "challenge_id": "xyz789",
  "name": "FizzBuzz Challenge",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "max_score": 100,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Submissions Collection (or Table)
```json
{
  "submission_id": "sub123",
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "challenge_id": "xyz789",
  "status": "completed",
  "execution_time": 2.5,  // Time in seconds
  "score": 95,
  "created_at": "2024-01-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Leaderboard (Query Result):
```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "username": "john_doe",
  "total_score": 350,
  "total_time": 150.0,  // Total time taken for all solved challenges
  "submissions": 15,
  "last_submission_time": "2024-01-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. **Backend Structure (Go)**
Here’s an example outline of how to build the leaderboard functionality in Go.

#### 2.1. **Go Structs**

```go
package main

import (
	"time"
)

// User model
type User struct {
	UserID    string    `json:"user_id" bson:"user_id"`
	Username  string    `json:"username" bson:"username"`
	Email     string    `json:"email" bson:"email"`
	CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at" bson:"created_at"`
	LastActive time.Time `json:"last_active" bson:"last_active"`
}

// Challenge model
type Challenge struct {
	ChallengeID string `json:"challenge_id" bson:"challenge_id"`
	Name        string `json:"name" bson:"name"`
	Difficulty  string `json:"difficulty" bson:"difficulty"`
	MaxScore    int    `json:"max_score" bson:"max_score"`
	CreatedAt   time.Time `json:"created_at" bson:"created_at"`
}

// Submission model
type Submission struct {
	SubmissionID string    `json:"submission_id" bson:"submission_id"`
	UserID       string    `json:"user_id" bson:"user_id"`
	ChallengeID  string    `json:"challenge_id" bson:"challenge_id"`
	Status       string    `json:"status" bson:"status"`
	ExecutionTime float64  `json:"execution_time" bson:"execution_time"`
	Score        int       `json:"score" bson:"score"`
	CreatedAt    time.Time `json:"created_at" bson:"created_at"`
}

// LeaderboardEntry model
type LeaderboardEntry struct {
	Rank            int       `json:"rank" bson:"rank"`
	UserID          string    `json:"user_id" bson:"user_id"`
	Username        string    `json:"username" bson:"username"`
	TotalScore      int       `json:"total_score" bson:"total_score"`
	TotalTime       float64   `json:"total_time" bson:"total_time"`
	Submissions     int       `json:"submissions" bson:"submissions"`
	LastSubmissionTime time.Time `json:"last_submission_time" bson:"last_submission_time"`
}
```

#### 2.2. **Leaderboard API Endpoint**

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"time"
)

// Database function to get leaderboard data from DB
func getLeaderboard() ([]LeaderboardEntry, error) {
	// Query the database to get all users' scores, total times, etc.
	// Use aggregation to calculate rank, score, and submissions
	// Return a list of leaderboard entries sorted by score or performance
	// For example, we can query MongoDB using aggregation to sort by total score

	// Mock data for now
	return []LeaderboardEntry{
		{Rank: 1, UserID: "abc123", Username: "john_doe", TotalScore: 350, TotalTime: 150.0, Submissions: 15, LastSubmissionTime: time.Now()},
		{Rank: 2, UserID: "xyz789", Username: "alice", TotalScore: 340, TotalTime: 155.0, Submissions: 12, LastSubmissionTime: time.Now()},
	}, nil
}

// Leaderboard endpoint handler
func leaderboardHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	// Fetch leaderboard data
	leaderboard, err := getLeaderboard()
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Failed to get leaderboard"})
		return
	}

	// Return the leaderboard as JSON
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, leaderboard)
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	// Define a leaderboard route
	r.GET("/leaderboard", leaderboardHandler)

	// Start the server
	r.Run(":8080")
}
```

#### 2.3. **Leaderboard Calculation Logic**

The **leaderboard calculation** can be done using a **MongoDB aggregation pipeline** that calculates scores, ranks, and other metrics. For example:

```go
pipeline := []bson.M{
	{
		"$group": bson.M{
			"_id": "$user_id",
			"total_score": bson.M{"$sum": "$score"},
			"total_time": bson.M{"$sum": "$execution_time"},
			"submissions": bson.M{"$sum": 1},
		},
	},
	{
		"$sort": bson.M{
			"total_score": -1, // Sort by score in descending order
			"total_time": 1,   // Sort by total time in ascending order if score is the same
		},
	},
	{
		"$project": bson.M{
			"user_id":       1,
			"total_score":   1,
			"total_time":    1,
			"submissions":   1,
			"rank":          1,
		},
	},
	{
		"$limit": 10, // Limit to top 10 leaderboard entries
	},
}
```

### 3. **Performance Considerations**

1. **Caching**: Cache leaderboard data using **Redis** to serve it quickly for the frontend. You can refresh the leaderboard cache periodically or after every submission.
   
2. **Real-Time Updates**: As new submissions come in, update scores and rankings in near real-time. Use **WebSockets** to push updates to the frontend.

3. **Pagination**: Implement pagination on the leaderboard API to avoid fetching too many records at once.

4. **Indexing**: Make sure to **index the `user_id`, `score`, and `submission_time`** fields in the database for fast queries.

---

### Conclusion

By following this structure, you can build an efficient backend for the **leaderboard** of a **code execution platform** like HackerRank. The key focus should be on:
- Efficient querying and sorting.
- Handling code submissions securely.
- Real-time leaderboard updates.
- Caching for better performance.

This Go backend will serve as a robust and scalable solution for such a platform. Let me know if you need further details or assistance on any particular part!


To implement a **multi-level leaderboard** and progressively harder **challenge questions** as users progress through levels, we can structure both the leaderboard and the challenge system to accommodate these requirements.

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Leaderboards with Levels**:
   - Users can progress through different levels based on their scores and performance.
   - Each level has a separate leaderboard (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).
   - Each level has different challenges, and the complexity increases as the user progresses.

2. **Progressive Difficulty**:
   - As users move up levels, the difficulty of the challenges they are given will increase.
   - Challenges will be associated with a difficulty rating and adjusted accordingly as the user level increases.

### Approach to Implement Multi-Level Leaderboard and Progressive Challenges

### 1. **User Levels**
Each user starts at a beginner level and progresses to harder levels based on their total score or time. These levels can be predefined as follows:

- **Level 1**: Bronze (Beginner)
- **Level 2**: Silver (Intermediate)
- **Level 3**: Gold (Advanced)

A user’s level is determined by their **total score** and **performance metrics** (e.g., speed and accuracy).

### 2. **Database Structure**
Modify the **Challenge** model to include a difficulty level, and add a `level` field for users to track their current level.

#### Updated Challenge Model with Difficulty Levels
```json
{
  "challenge_id": "xyz789",
  "name": "FizzBuzz Challenge",
  "difficulty": "easy",   // can be easy, medium, hard
  "level": 1,             // Maps to the level for a challenge (e.g., Level 1 for Bronze)
  "max_score": 100,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Updated User Model with Level
```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "level": 1,  // Tracks user level (1 = Bronze, 2 = Silver, 3 = Gold)
  "total_score": 150,
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "last_active": "2024-01-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 3. **Backend Logic for Levels**

#### Level Calculation:
You can calculate the user’s level based on their total score or other criteria. For example:
- **Level 1**: Score between `0 - 100`
- **Level 2**: Score between `101 - 300`
- **Level 3**: Score above `300`

This can be updated in real-time as users complete challenges and submit their answers.

#### Sample Logic to Calculate User Level (Go)
```go
// Define user levels
const (
	BRONZE = 1
	SILVER = 2
	GOLD   = 3
)

// Update User Level Based on Score
func updateUserLevel(user *User) {
	switch {
	case user.TotalScore <= 100:
		user.Level = BRONZE
	case user.TotalScore <= 300:
		user.Level = SILVER
	default:
		user.Level = GOLD
	}
}
```

#### Getting Challenges Based on Level
When a user reaches a particular level, they should only be able to access challenges that are appropriate for that level. For instance:

- **Level 1 (Bronze)** will have access to **easy** challenges.
- **Level 2 (Silver)** will have access to **medium** challenges.
- **Level 3 (Gold)** will have access to **hard** challenges.

To implement this, you can filter challenges by their level and difficulty.

#### Sample Query to Get Challenges for a Level (Go)
```go
// Get Challenges based on User Level
func getChallengesForLevel(userLevel int) ([]Challenge, error) {
	var challenges []Challenge
	var difficulty string

	// Map user level to challenge difficulty
	switch userLevel {
	case BRONZE:
		difficulty = "easy"
	case SILVER:
		difficulty = "medium"
	case GOLD:
		difficulty = "hard"
	default:
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid level")
	}

	// Query the database for challenges matching the difficulty
	// (Replace with your DB query logic - e.g., MongoDB, SQL)
	challenges = fetchChallengesByDifficulty(difficulty)

	return challenges, nil
}
```

### 4. **Leaderboard with Levels**

For the leaderboard, you’ll need to manage **separate leaderboards** for each level. This way, users will be ranked within their respective level, and you can promote users to higher levels when they score enough.

#### Example Leaderboard Data
```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "username": "john_doe",
  "total_score": 350,
  "level": 3,   // Current level
  "submissions": 15,
  "last_submission_time": "2024-01-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### MongoDB Query to Get Leaderboard by Level
```go
// Fetch leaderboard for a specific level (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold)
func getLeaderboardForLevel(level int) ([]LeaderboardEntry, error) {
	// Assuming `leaderboards` collection stores leaderboard data per level
	var leaderboard []LeaderboardEntry

	// Query to get the leaderboard entries for a given level, sorted by total_score
	// (Replace with your DB query logic)
	leaderboard = fetchLeaderboardForLevel(level)

	return leaderboard, nil
}
```

### 5. **Real-Time Leaderboard Updates**

To keep the leaderboard up-to-date in real-time:
- **WebSockets**: Push updates to the frontend whenever a user’s score changes or when new challenges are completed.
- **Redis**: Cache leaderboard data to speed up access times for frequently requested information.

#### Sample WebSocket Update (Go)
```go
func handleScoreUpdate(userID string, newScore int) {
	// Update the user score in the database
	updateUserScore(userID, newScore)

	// Recalculate the user's level
	user := getUser(userID)
	updateUserLevel(user)

	// Broadcast updated leaderboard to all clients
	broadcastLeaderboardUpdate()
}
```

### 6. **Example API Endpoints**

1. **Get Challenges Based on Level**:
   ```go
   r.GET("/challenges", func(c *gin.Context) {
       userID := c.Param("user_id")
       user := getUser(userID)
       challenges, err := getChallengesForLevel(user.Level)
       if err != nil {
           c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
           return
       }
       c.JSON(http.StatusOK, challenges)
   })
   ```

2. **Get Leaderboard for a Level**:
   ```go
   r.GET("/leaderboard/:level", func(c *gin.Context) {
       level := c.Param("level")
       leaderboard, err := getLeaderboardForLevel(level)
       if err != nil {
           c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
           return
       }
       c.JSON(http.StatusOK, leaderboard)
   })
   ```

### 7. **Leaderboard Ranking and Scoring**

Each submission can be evaluated for:
- **Accuracy** (Does the code produce correct results?)
- **Execution Time** (How fast is the solution?)
- **Penalty Points** (For wrong answers or time limits exceeded)

Use these metrics to calculate **score** and determine user ranking.

#### Sample Leaderboard Calculation
```go
func calculateLeaderboard() {
	// Fetch users and their scores
	users := getAllUsers()

	// Calculate ranks for each user based on their score
	for _, user := range users {
		updateUserLevel(&user) // Update user level based on their total score
		// Save updated user level and score
		updateUserInDatabase(user)
	}

	// Fetch and sort leaderboard based on scores
	leaderboard := fetchLeaderboard()
}
```
To implement a production-ready leaderboard and challenge system in Go, we'll need to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable components. Here's a detailed approach to implementing a leaderboard system in Go, ensuring it's scalable, fault-tolerant, and optimized for production:

### **1. Database Design**
   The first step is designing the database to store user data, challenge information, and leaderboard results. We'll use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability, but for simplicity, this example assumes a PostgreSQL database.

#### **Tables:**
- **users**: Store user information.
- **challenges**: Store challenge metadata and difficulty levels.
- **leaderboards**: Track user progress on leaderboards.
- **user_scores**: Store individual user challenge scores.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE challenges (
    challenge_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    difficulty_level INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE leaderboards (
    leaderboard_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    total_score INT DEFAULT 0,
    rank INT DEFAULT 0,
    level INT DEFAULT 1, -- Levels like Bronze, Silver, Gold
    last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE user_scores (
    score_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    challenge_id INT REFERENCES challenges(challenge_id),
    score INT,
    submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

### **2. Core Go Logic**

#### **Data Models**

First, define your Go structs that map to the database tables using `gorm` (a popular ORM for Go) or plain SQL if preferred. We’ll use `gorm` for this example.

```go
package models

import (
	"time"

	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

// User model
type User struct {
	UserID      uint      `json:"user_id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
	Username    string    `json:"username" gorm:"unique;not null"`
	Email       string    `json:"email" gorm:"unique"`
	PasswordHash string   `json:"password_hash" gorm:"not null"`
	CreatedAt   time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}

// Challenge model
type Challenge struct {
	ChallengeID   uint      `json:"challenge_id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
	Title         string    `json:"title" gorm:"not null"`
	Description   string    `json:"description"`
	DifficultyLevel int      `json:"difficulty_level" gorm:"not null"`
	CreatedAt     time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}

// Leaderboard model
type Leaderboard struct {
	LeaderboardID uint      `json:"leaderboard_id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
	UserID        uint      `json:"user_id" gorm:"not null"`
	TotalScore    int       `json:"total_score" gorm:"default:0"`
	Rank          int       `json:"rank" gorm:"default:0"`
	Level         int       `json:"level" gorm:"default:1"`
	LastUpdated   time.Time `json:"last_updated"`
}

// UserScore model
type UserScore struct {
	ScoreID    uint      `json:"score_id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
	UserID     uint      `json:"user_id" gorm:"not null"`
	ChallengeID uint     `json:"challenge_id" gorm:"not null"`
	Score      int       `json:"score" gorm:"not null"`
	SubmittedAt time.Time `json:"submitted_at"`
}
```

---

### **3. Implementing the Leaderboard System**

1. **Leaderboard Calculation:**

   The leaderboard is typically calculated based on the total score of each user across challenges. Here's a basic function to calculate and update the leaderboard:

```go
package leaderboard

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"yourapp/models"
)

// CalculateLeaderboard updates the leaderboard with the current total score
func CalculateLeaderboard(db *gorm.DB) error {
	var users []models.User
	if err := db.Find(&users).Error; err != nil {
		return err
	}

	for _, user := range users {
		var totalScore int
		err := db.Model(&models.UserScore{}).Where("user_id = ?", user.UserID).Select("sum(score)").Scan(&totalScore).Error
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to calculate total score for user %d: %v", user.UserID, err)
		}

		// Update the leaderboard with the new score
		leaderboard := models.Leaderboard{}
		err = db.Where("user_id = ?", user.UserID).FirstOrCreate(&leaderboard).Error
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to find or create leaderboard for user %d: %v", user.UserID, err)
		}

		leaderboard.TotalScore = totalScore
		err = db.Save(&leaderboard).Error
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to update leaderboard for user %d: %v", user.UserID, err)
		}
	}

	return nil
}
```

2. **Updating User Rank:**

   You can periodically recalculate ranks based on the user's total score:

```go
package leaderboard

import (
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"yourapp/models"
	"gorm.io/gorm/clause"
)

// UpdateRank updates the rank of each user based on their total score
func UpdateRank(db *gorm.DB) error {
	var leaderboards []models.Leaderboard
	if err := db.Order("total_score desc").Find(&leaderboards).Error; err != nil {
		return err
	}

	for rank, leaderboard := range leaderboards {
		leaderboard.Rank = rank + 1
		if err := db.Model(&leaderboard).Update("rank", leaderboard.Rank).Error; err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
	return nil
}
```

3. **Handling Challenge Submissions:**

   This function would save the score when a user submits their challenge:

```go
package challenges

import (
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"yourapp/models"
)

// SubmitChallenge saves the user's score after completing a challenge
func SubmitChallenge(db *gorm.DB, userID, challengeID, score int) error {
	userScore := models.UserScore{
		UserID:     uint(userID),
		ChallengeID: uint(challengeID),
		Score:      score,
	}

	if err := db.Create(&userScore).Error; err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Recalculate the leaderboard after the new score
	err := leaderboard.CalculateLeaderboard(db)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Update rank based on the new score
	err = leaderboard.UpdateRank(db)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}
```

---

### **4. Handling Difficulty and Dynamic Challenges**

To make the challenges progressively harder as users level up, you can have different categories of challenges and difficulty levels.

- **Challenges Table:** Track the difficulty level of each challenge (easy, medium, hard).
- **Dynamic Querying:** Dynamically serve challenges based on the user's level.

```go
package challenges

import (
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"yourapp/models"
)

// GetChallengesForUser returns challenges based on user level
func GetChallengesForUser(db *gorm.DB, userID uint) ([]models.Challenge, error) {
	var userLevel int
	err := db.Model(&models.Leaderboard{}).Where("user_id = ?", userID).Select("level").First(&userLevel).Error
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	var challenges []models.Challenge
	err = db.Where("difficulty_level <= ?", userLevel).Find(&challenges).Error
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return challenges, nil
}
```

---

### **5. API Routes**

For the backend API, you will likely use a framework like `Gin` or `Echo`. Example of an API route to submit a challenge and calculate the leaderboard:

```go
package routes

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"yourapp/challenges"
	"yourapp/models"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

func SubmitChallengeRoute(c *gin.Context) {
	var req struct {
		UserID      int `json:"user_id"`
		ChallengeID int `json:"challenge_id"`
		Score       int `json:"score"`
	}
	if err := c.BindJSON(&req); err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": "Invalid input"})
		return
	}

	db, err := gorm.Open("postgres", "your_connection_string")
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Database connection failed"})
		return
	}

	err = challenges.SubmitChallenge(db, req.UserID, req.ChallengeID, req.Score)
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{"error": "Failed to submit challenge"})
		return
	}

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"message": "Challenge submitted successfully"})
}
```

---

### **6. Additional Features**

1. **Real-Time Updates**: For real-time leaderboard updates, you could integrate with **WebSockets**.
2. **Caching**: Use Redis for

 caching leaderboard data and reduce database load, especially for frequently accessed data.
3. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Implement robust tests using Go's testing framework or a testing tool like `Testify` to ensure your code is bug-free.
4. **Deployment**: Use Docker and Kubernetes to manage deployment at scale.
5. **Security**: Use JWT for secure API endpoints, especially for authentication, and ensure that sensitive data like passwords are hashed securely (e.g., bcrypt).

---

### **Conclusion**

This approach outlines a basic but production-ready architecture for a leaderboard system. It includes dynamic difficulty adjustment, challenge tracking, real-time leaderboard updates, and scalable database interaction. By combining Go's efficiency with a robust relational database and caching mechanisms, you can implement a fast, fault-tolerant backend for your code execution platform's leaderboard system.

To implement **adaptive challenges** and **predictive leaderboards** using **Golang** and **Elasticsearch**, we need to focus on data analysis, real-time updates, and predictive modeling. Here's a complete, production-ready approach to build these two key features.

---

## **1. System Design**

We'll need the following core components for the system:

### **Tech Stack**
- **Backend:** Golang (for API, logic, and data processing)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational data) and **Elasticsearch** (for real-time leaderboard and analytics)
- **Cache:** Redis (for real-time leaderboard caching)
- **Message Queue:** Kafka (for tracking real-time user events and scores)
- **Containerization:** Docker & Kubernetes (for deployment)
- **AI Models:** TensorFlow/ML models for adaptive challenges and predictive leaderboards

---

### **Database Design**

1. **Users Table**: Tracks user information.
2. **Challenges Table**: Stores challenge metadata (difficulty, scores, etc.).
3. **User_Challenge Table**: Tracks user progress and performance on each challenge.
4. **Leaderboard Table**: Tracks user ranks, total scores, and progress level.

---

### **Elasticsearch Setup**
Elasticsearch is used to provide **real-time leaderboard tracking** and **predictive analytics** for users. The key documents stored in Elasticsearch will be **user performance logs** and **leaderboard data**.

**Index Design (Elasticsearch)**
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "user_id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "score": { "type": "integer" },
      "level": { "type": "integer" },
      "completion_time": { "type": "date" },
      "predicted_rank": { "type": "integer" },
      "user_activity": { "type": "nested" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
- `score`: The current score for a specific challenge.
- `level`: Current level of the user (1 = easy, 2 = medium, 3 = hard, etc.).
- `completion_time`: Time when the user submitted the challenge.
- `predicted_rank`: The system's predicted rank for the user based on historical performance.
- `user_activity`: A nested field that stores user event logs (e.g., "submission times", "challenge attempts", etc.).

---

## **2. Adaptive Challenges**

**Goal**: Dynamically increase or decrease the difficulty of challenges as the user progresses.

### **Logic for Adaptive Challenges**
1. **User Analysis**: Track user's performance (time taken, number of attempts, score) for each challenge.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Use metrics like:
   - **Time to Complete**: How fast did the user complete the previous challenge?
   - **Success Rate**: Did the user succeed on the first try?
   - **Skill Trend**: Are the user's challenge scores increasing or decreasing?
3. **AI Model**: Use this data to predict the next challenge difficulty (easy, medium, or hard).

---

### **Implementation**

**1. Golang Code for Adaptive Challenge Selection**

```go
package challenges

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"github.com/olivere/elastic/v7"
)

// AdaptiveChallenge selects the next challenge for the user based on their performance
func AdaptiveChallenge(db *gorm.DB, es *elastic.Client, userID uint) (Challenge, error) {
	var userPerformance UserPerformance
	var nextChallenge Challenge

	// Query the user's performance from Elasticsearch
	query := elastic.NewBoolQuery().Filter(elastic.NewTermQuery("user_id", userID))
	searchResult, err := es.Search().Index("user_performance").Query(query).Do(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		return nextChallenge, fmt.Errorf("failed to query Elasticsearch: %v", err)
	}

	// Analyze user performance
	if searchResult.TotalHits() > 0 {
		for _, hit := range searchResult.Hits.Hits {
			err := json.Unmarshal(hit.Source, &userPerformance)
			if err != nil {
				log.Printf("Failed to unmarshal user performance: %v", err)
			}
		}
	}

	// Determine the next difficulty level
	nextDifficulty := 1
	if userPerformance.Score > 80 {
		nextDifficulty = 2 // Move to Medium level
	} else if userPerformance.Score > 90 {
		nextDifficulty = 3 // Move to Hard level
	}

	// Select a challenge from the database
	err = db.Where("difficulty_level = ?", nextDifficulty).Order("RANDOM()").First(&nextChallenge).Error
	if err != nil {
		return nextChallenge, fmt.Errorf("failed to select next challenge: %v", err)
	}

	return nextChallenge, nil
}
```

---

## **3. Predictive Leaderboards**

**Goal**: Use AI to predict a user's future leaderboard rank.

---

### **Logic for Predictive Leaderboards**
1. **Historical Data**: Use Elasticsearch to analyze historical user performance.
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Use **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** or **Machine Learning (ML) models** to predict future rank.
3. **Rank Prediction**: Update the user's **predicted rank** in Elasticsearch.
4. **User Insights**: Provide users with personalized insights on how to improve their rank.

---

### **Implementation**

**1. Elasticsearch Query for User Historical Data**

```go
// Query user historical data from Elasticsearch
query := elastic.NewBoolQuery().Filter(elastic.NewTermQuery("user_id", userID))
result, err := es.Search().Index("user_performance").Query(query).Do(context.Background())
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error retrieving user data: %v", err)
}
```

**2. Predictive Rank Calculation (Simple Moving Average)**

```go
func PredictRank(userScores []int) int {
	if len(userScores) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	// Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the user's last 5 scores
	sum := 0
	for _, score := range userScores[len(userScores)-5:] {
		sum += score
	}
	return sum / 5
}
```

**3. Update Predicted Rank in Elasticsearch**

```go
_, err := es.Update().
	Index("user_performance").
	Id(fmt.Sprintf("%d", userID)).
	Doc(map[string]interface{}{"predicted_rank": predictedRank}).
	Do(context.Background())
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Failed to update Elasticsearch document: %v", err)
}
```

---

## **4. Real-Time Leaderboards**

To keep the leaderboards **real-time**, we'll:
1. Use **Redis** to cache top leaderboard results.
2. Use **Kafka** to track user events and scores.
3. Rebuild the leaderboard periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds) and push it to Redis.

---

### **Leaderboard Calculation**

**1. Calculate Leaderboard from Elasticsearch**

```go
// Get leaderboard from Elasticsearch
query := elastic.NewMatchAllQuery()
res, err := es.Search().Index("user_performance").Query(query).Sort("total_score", false).Size(10).Do(context.Background())
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Failed to query leaderboard: %v", err)
}
```

**2. Cache Leaderboard in Redis**

```go
import (
	"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"
)

func CacheLeaderboard(rdb *redis.Client, leaderboard []map[string]interface{}) {
	ctx := context.Background()
	err := rdb.Set(ctx, "leaderboard", leaderboard, 10*time.Second).Err()
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Failed to cache leaderboard: %v", err)
	}
}
```

---

## **5. API Endpoints**

| Endpoint         | Method | Description            |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------|
| `/leaderboard`    | `GET`  | Get real-time leaderboard |
| `/predict-rank`   | `GET`  | Predict user rank       |
| `/adaptive-challenge` | `GET`  | Get next challenge      |

---

### **API Example (Gin)**
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET("/leaderboard", GetLeaderboard)
	router.GET("/adaptive-challenge", GetAdaptiveChallenge)
	router.GET("/predict-rank", GetPredictedRank)

	router.Run(":8080")
}

func GetLeaderboard(c *gin.Context) {
	// Fetch leaderboard from Redis
	leaderboard, _ := rdb.Get(c, "leaderboard").Result()
	c.JSON(200, leaderboard)
}

func GetAdaptiveChallenge(c *gin.Context) {
	// Call the adaptive challenge function
	challenge, _ := AdaptiveChallenge(db, es, userID)
	c.JSON(200, challenge)
}

func GetPredictedRank(c *gin.Context) {
	// Call the rank prediction logic
	predictedRank := PredictRank([]int{80, 85, 90, 95, 100})
	c.JSON(200, map[string]int{"predicted_rank": predictedRank})
}
```

---

With **adaptive challenges** and **predictive leaderboards**, you create a competitive and personalized user experience, motivating users to improve. Integrating **Elasticsearch, Redis, Kafka**, and **Golang** allows for **real-time, AI-driven analytics** and a scalable production system.


### Conclusion

By implementing a **multi-level leaderboard** system where users are ranked and challenged based on their level, and progressively harder challenges are provided, you can create an engaging and rewarding experience for users. As users level up, they get access to more complex challenges and can see their rank among others.

This system will not only track the user's progress but also give them an incentive to continue solving problems and improving their skills. You can further enhance it by adding features like **badges**, **achievements**, and **daily challenges**.

Let me know if you need any further details or more code examples!

Here** are some possible features you can implement in the leaderboard scenario for a code execution platform:

---

## **6. Business Logic**

---

### **1. Adaptive Challenges**
1. Users request a challenge via `/adaptive-challenge`.
2. **Logic**: 
   - Check the user's **current level** (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
   - Fetch a random challenge with matching difficulty from the **Challenges** table.
3. If user wins multiple times, promote them to the next level.

---

### **2. Real-Time Leaderboards**
1. Leaderboards are cached in **Redis** for fast retrieval.
2. Leaderboards are split into **3 categories**: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
3. **How it works**:
   - Redis holds the top 50 users for each level.
   - If Redis cache is invalid, Elasticsearch is queried.
   - User rank changes are streamed via **Kafka** to update the leaderboard.

---

### **3. User Progression**
1. **Start at Easy**.
2. **Promotion Rules**:
   - If a user wins 3 consecutive Easy challenges, they move to **Medium**.
   - If a user wins 3 consecutive Medium challenges, they move to **Hard**.

---

### **4. Predictive Rank**
1. Use **AI/ML (TensorFlow)** to predict rank.
2. Input data:
   - Past 5 user scores.
   - Average completion time.
   - Average difficulty of past challenges.
3. Predicts user's future rank in the leaderboard.

	_ = c.BindJSON(&submission)

	UpdateUserScore(submission)
	PublishToKafka("user_score_updates", submission)
	c.JSON(200, "Score submitted")
}
```

---

### **5. Promotion Logic**

```go
func PromoteUser(userID int) {
	user := GetUser(userID)
	if user.Level == 1 && UserWonMultipleChallenges(userID) {
		PromoteUserToLevel(userID, 2) // Easy → Medium
	} else if user.Level == 2 && UserWonMultipleChallenges(userID) {

## **3. Business Logic**

### **1. Leaderboard Calculation**
- Track **rank**, **total score**, **accuracy**, **speed**, and **quality**.
- Redis cache holds top 50 users for each leaderboard.
- If cache expires, refresh data from Elasticsearch.

---

### **2. Accuracy Calculation**
**Formula**: 
```sql
accuracy = (total_correct_submissions / total_submissions) * 100
```
**How it works**:
- Every user has a running total of how many of their submissions were correct.
- Each new submission updates their accuracy metric.

---

### **3. Speed Calculation**
**Formula**: 
```sql
speed_avg = total_time / total_submissions
```
**How it works**:
- Measure how quickly users submit answers from when they start the challenge.
- This is used to update their speed average metric.

---

### **4. Penalties for Incorrect Answers**
**Logic**:
- If the user submits an incorrect answer, deduct **penalty points**.
- Store the penalty in the **Submissions table** and apply it to the **Users table**.

---

### **5. Solution Quality**
- Compare the user's solution to the **optimal solution**.
- Measure the **execution time**.
- Rank users higher if their execution time is closer to the optimal.

---

## **4. API Implementation**

---

### **1. Get Leaderboard**

```go
func GetLeaderboard(c *gin.Context) {
	level := c.Param("level")
	cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("leaderboard_%s", level)

	leaderboard, err := redisClient.Get(c, cacheKey).Result()
	if err == redis.Nil {
		esQuery := elastic.NewSearchRequest().Index("leaderboard").Query(elastic.NewMatchQuery("level", level)).Sort("total_score", false).Size(10)
		searchResult, _ := esQuery.Do(context.Background())
		redisClient.Set(c, cacheKey, searchResult, 10*time.Minute)
		c.JSON(200, searchResult)
	} else {
		c.JSON(200, leaderboard)
	}
}
```

---

### **2. Submit Score**

```go
func SubmitScore(c *gin.Context) {
	var submission Submission
	_ = c.BindJSON(&submission)

	// Save submission to database
	db.Exec("INSERT INTO submissions (user_id, challenge_id, is_correct, attempts, time_taken, code_quality, penalty_points) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", 
		submission.UserID, submission.ChallengeID, submission.IsCorrect, submission.Attempts, submission.TimeTaken, submission.CodeQuality, submission.PenaltyPoints)
	
	// Update user's metrics
	if submission.IsCorrect {
		UpdateUserMetrics(submission)
	}
	c.JSON(200, "Score submitted")
}
```

---

### **3. Predict Rank**

```go
func PredictRank(c *gin.Context) {
	userID := c.Query("user_id")
	performance := GetUserPerformance(userID)
	rankPrediction := PredictRankFromAI(performance)
	c.JSON(200, map[string]int{"predicted_rank": rankPrediction})
}
```

---

### **4. Update User Metrics**

```go
func UpdateUserMetrics(submission Submission) {
	db.Exec(`UPDATE users SET 
		total_score = total_score + ?, 
		accuracy = (correct_submissions / total_submissions) * 100, 
		speed_avg = (total_time + ?) / (total_submissions + 1) 
		WHERE user_id = ?`, 
		submission.Score, submission.TimeTaken, submission.UserID)
}
```

---

### **5. Apply Penalty**

```go
func ApplyPenalty(userID int, points int) {
	db.Exec("UPDATE users SET penalty_points = penalty_points + ? WHERE user_id = ?", points, userID)
}
```

---

### **6. Promotion to Higher Levels**

```go
func PromoteUser(userID int) {
	user := GetUser(userID)
	if user.Level == 1 && UserWonMultipleChallenges(userID) {
		PromoteUserToLevel(userID, 2)
	} else if user.Level == 2 && UserWonMultipleChallenges(userID) {
		PromoteUserToLevel(userID, 3)
	}
}
```

---

## **Summary**
This system tracks **accuracy**, **speed**, **penalties**, and **solution quality**, while promoting users through 3 difficulty levels. **AI predictions** for rank changes ensure competitive engagement. Using **Redis, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch**, the leaderboard is efficient, fast, and scalable.
