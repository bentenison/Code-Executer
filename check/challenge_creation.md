Given the updated requirements for handling challenges in a series of 3 questions, with specific constraints such as:

1. **3 Attempts per Question Per Day**: A user can only attempt each question in the challenge 3 times per day.
2. **No Repeated Questions**: If a user has already faced a particular question in a previous challenge, that question should not appear again in the next challenge.

### Struct Design

We'll need to update the data models to track user attempts per day for each question and manage a list of questions they've already faced. Below are the updated structs and implementation details for these requirements.

#### Structs

1. **User**: This remains the same but will need to track which questions a user has attempted.
2. **Challenge**: Now, we will have a series of 3 questions per challenge. We need to store the questions within each challenge.
3. **UserChallenge**: This will track which questions the user has attempted for each challenge and how many attempts they've made per question.
4. **Question**: A new struct to represent the individual questions.

Here are the updated structs:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// User represents a user in the system
type User struct {
	UserID      string    `json:"user_id"`
	Username    string    `json:"username"`
	Rank        int       `json:"rank"`
	CreatedAt   time.Time `json:"created_at"`
	AttemptedQuestions []string `json:"attempted_questions"` // List of question IDs user has faced
}

// Question represents a single challenge question
type Question struct {
	QuestionID   string `json:"question_id"`
	Title        string `json:"title"`
	Description  string `json:"description"`
	Logic        string `json:"logic"`
	Difficulty   string `json:"difficulty"`
	Tags         []string `json:"tags"`
}

// Challenge represents a set of 3 questions in a series
type Challenge struct {
	ChallengeID  string    `json:"challenge_id"`
	UserID       string    `json:"user_id"`
	Questions    []Question `json:"questions"` // List of 3 questions in this challenge
	CreatedAt    time.Time `json:"created_at"`
	Completed    bool      `json:"completed"`
	CompletionDate time.Time `json:"completion_date"`
}

// UserChallenge tracks the user’s attempts for each challenge
type UserChallenge struct {
	UserID        string    `json:"user_id"`
	ChallengeID   string    `json:"challenge_id"`
	QuestionsAttempted map[string]int // Tracks question_id and number of attempts
	Completed     bool      `json:"completed"`
	CreatedAt     time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}
```

### Steps to Implement the Logic

1. **Check User’s Previous Attempts**:
   We need to check whether the user has already faced any of the 3 questions from the challenge series. If the user has already attempted any of these questions, we should exclude them from the new challenge.

2. **Check User’s Daily Attempts**:
   We need to ensure that the user can only attempt each question a maximum of 3 times per day.

3. **Create a New Challenge**:
   We will generate a new challenge, selecting 3 questions that the user hasn’t faced yet and haven’t exceeded the attempt limit for the day.

4. **Track Attempts in the `UserChallenge`**:
   For each question, we will track the number of attempts made by the user in that challenge.

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Get User’s Attempted Questions

We will retrieve the user’s data to check the questions they’ve attempted.

```go
// GetUser retrieves a user's information from the database
func getUser(userID string) (*User, error) {
	// Fetch user from the database (example MongoDB query)
	var user User
	// db.FindOne("users", bson.M{"user_id": userID}).Decode(&user)

	// If user is not found, create a new user and return
	if user.UserID == "" {
		user = User{
			UserID:      userID,
			Username:    "New User",
			Rank:        1,
			CreatedAt:   time.Now(),
			AttemptedQuestions: []string{}, // No questions attempted initially
		}
		// db.Insert("users", user)
	}
	return &user, nil
}
```

#### Step 2: Select Questions for the Challenge

We'll select 3 new questions that the user hasn't seen before and ensure that they haven't exceeded their 3 attempts per day for each question.

```go
// GetAvailableQuestions selects 3 new questions for the challenge
func getAvailableQuestions(user *User, allQuestions []Question) ([]Question, error) {
	var availableQuestions []Question
	var selectedQuestions []Question

	// Iterate over all available questions and filter out those that the user has already faced or exceeded the attempt limit
	for _, question := range allQuestions {
		// Check if the user has already attempted this question
		if !contains(user.AttemptedQuestions, question.QuestionID) {
			availableQuestions = append(availableQuestions, question)
		}
	}

	// Select 3 random questions from availableQuestions
	if len(availableQuestions) < 3 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("not enough new questions available")
	}

	// Select 3 random questions for the user
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		selectedQuestions = append(selectedQuestions, availableQuestions[i])
	}

	return selectedQuestions, nil
}

// Helper function to check if a slice contains a specific question ID
func contains(slice []string, item string) bool {
	for _, s := range slice {
		if s == item {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Challenge for the User

Once we have the available questions, we create a challenge for the user.

```go
// CreateChallenge creates a new challenge for the user with 3 questions
func createChallenge(user *User, allQuestions []Question) (*Challenge, error) {
	// Get 3 new questions for the user
	selectedQuestions, err := getAvailableQuestions(user, allQuestions)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// Create the new challenge
	challenge := &Challenge{
		ChallengeID: fmt.Sprintf("%s-challenge-%d", user.UserID, time.Now().Unix()),
		UserID:      user.UserID,
		Questions:   selectedQuestions,
		CreatedAt:   time.Now(),
		Completed:   false,
	}

	// Example: Insert challenge into database
	// db.Insert("challenges", challenge)

	// Return the created challenge
	return challenge, nil
}
```

#### Step 4: Store the User Challenge

We now track the user’s attempts and ensure that they don't exceed 3 attempts per day for each question.

```go
// TrackUserChallenge tracks user attempts and ensures they don't exceed 3 attempts per question
func trackUserChallenge(user *User, challenge *Challenge) error {
	// Create a new UserChallenge entry
	userChallenge := &UserChallenge{
		UserID:        user.UserID,
		ChallengeID:   challenge.ChallengeID,
		QuestionsAttempted: make(map[string]int),
		Completed:     false,
		CreatedAt:     time.Now(),
	}

	// Example: Insert into database
	// db.Insert("user_challenges", userChallenge)

	return nil
}
```

### Step 5: Updating Attempted Questions After Each Attempt

Whenever a user makes an attempt, we update the number of attempts for that question.

```go
// UpdateUserAttempts updates the attempt count for a question after a user attempts it
func updateUserAttempts(user *User, questionID string) error {
	// Check if the user has attempted the question before
	if contains(user.AttemptedQuestions, questionID) {
		// Update the number of attempts for the specific question
		// Example: Update the attempts in the database
	}

	// If not, add the question to the list of attempted questions
	user.AttemptedQuestions = append(user.AttemptedQuestions, questionID)

	// Example: Update user record in the database
	// db.Update("users", bson.M{"user_id": user.UserID}, bson.M{"$set": bson.M{"attempted_questions": user.AttemptedQuestions}})

	return nil
}
```

### Full Example of User Challenge Flow

```go
func handleUserVisit(userID string, allQuestions []Question) {
	// Step 1: Get User Data
	user, err := getUser(userID)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error getting user:", err)
		return
	}

	// Step 2: Create Challenge for User
	challenge, err := createChallenge(user, allQuestions)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating challenge:", err)
		return
	}

	// Step 3: Store User Challenge Data
	err = trackUserChallenge(user, challenge)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error storing user challenge:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Challenge created and stored for user:", user.UserID)
}
```

### Conclusion

This implementation dynamically creates challenges for users with 3 unique questions per challenge and ensures that users cannot repeat questions from previous challenges. It tracks the number of attempts per question per day and prevents users from exceeding 3 attempts. Additionally, it stores relevant information about the challenge and updates the user's attempted questions list. This approach can be further enhanced depending on additional business requirements.



If challenges are based on user-selected languages, we can modify the implementation to handle different languages for each challenge. Each user will select a language, and based on this, we will provide challenges in the corresponding language. Here's how we can implement that:

### Updated Structs

We need to add a field to the `User` struct for tracking the selected programming language, and we will also need to ensure that each `Challenge` includes the language-specific challenge.

#### Struct Definitions

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// User represents a user in the system
type User struct {
	UserID          string    `json:"user_id"`
	Username        string    `json:"username"`
	Rank            int       `json:"rank"`
	CreatedAt       time.Time `json:"created_at"`
	AttemptedQuestions []string `json:"attempted_questions"` // List of question IDs user has faced
	SelectedLanguage string   `json:"selected_language"` // User's selected programming language
}

// Question represents a single challenge question
type Question struct {
	QuestionID   string `json:"question_id"`
	Title        string `json:"title"`
	Description  string `json:"description"`
	Logic        string `json:"logic"`
	Difficulty   string `json:"difficulty"`
	Tags         []string `json:"tags"`
	Language     string `json:"language"` // Language the question is written in
}

// Challenge represents a set of 3 questions in a series
type Challenge struct {
	ChallengeID  string    `json:"challenge_id"`
	UserID       string    `json:"user_id"`
	Questions    []Question `json:"questions"` // List of 3 questions in this challenge
	CreatedAt    time.Time `json:"created_at"`
	Completed    bool      `json:"completed"`
	CompletionDate time.Time `json:"completion_date"`
	Language     string    `json:"language"` // Language the challenge is created for
}

// UserChallenge tracks the user’s attempts for each challenge
type UserChallenge struct {
	UserID        string    `json:"user_id"`
	ChallengeID   string    `json:"challenge_id"`
	QuestionsAttempted map[string]int // Tracks question_id and number of attempts
	Completed     bool      `json:"completed"`
	CreatedAt     time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}
```

### Modified Steps to Implement the Logic

Now we need to incorporate the selected language into the challenge creation and ensure that each user gets challenges that are written in their selected language.

#### Step 1: Get User’s Selected Language

We will retrieve the user's selected language, which will be stored in the `User` struct.

```go
// GetUser retrieves a user's information from the database
func getUser(userID string) (*User, error) {
	// Fetch user from the database (example MongoDB query)
	var user User
	// db.FindOne("users", bson.M{"user_id": userID}).Decode(&user)

	// If user is not found, create a new user and return
	if user.UserID == "" {
		user = User{
			UserID:      userID,
			Username:    "New User",
			Rank:        1,
			CreatedAt:   time.Now(),
			AttemptedQuestions: []string{}, // No questions attempted initially
			SelectedLanguage: "python", // Default language (could be set during user registration)
		}
		// db.Insert("users", user)
	}
	return &user, nil
}
```

#### Step 2: Filter Questions Based on User's Language

Now, we need to filter the questions based on the user's selected language. We will modify the `getAvailableQuestions` function to ensure that only questions written in the user's selected language are selected for the challenge.

```go
// GetAvailableQuestions selects 3 new questions for the challenge based on user's selected language
func getAvailableQuestions(user *User, allQuestions []Question) ([]Question, error) {
	var availableQuestions []Question
	var selectedQuestions []Question

	// Iterate over all available questions and filter out those that the user has already faced or exceed the attempt limit
	for _, question := range allQuestions {
		// Ensure the question matches the user's selected language
		if question.Language == user.SelectedLanguage && !contains(user.AttemptedQuestions, question.QuestionID) {
			availableQuestions = append(availableQuestions, question)
		}
	}

	// Select 3 random questions from availableQuestions
	if len(availableQuestions) < 3 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("not enough new questions available for the selected language")
	}

	// Select 3 random questions for the user
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		selectedQuestions = append(selectedQuestions, availableQuestions[i])
	}

	return selectedQuestions, nil
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Challenge for the User

The challenge will now be created in the language selected by the user. The `Challenge` struct will include the language field.

```go
// CreateChallenge creates a new challenge for the user with 3 questions in their selected language
func createChallenge(user *User, allQuestions []Question) (*Challenge, error) {
	// Get 3 new questions for the user based on their selected language
	selectedQuestions, err := getAvailableQuestions(user, allQuestions)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// Create the new challenge
	challenge := &Challenge{
		ChallengeID: fmt.Sprintf("%s-challenge-%d", user.UserID, time.Now().Unix()),
		UserID:      user.UserID,
		Questions:   selectedQuestions,
		CreatedAt:   time.Now(),
		Completed:   false,
		Language:    user.SelectedLanguage, // Set language for the challenge
	}

	// Example: Insert challenge into the database
	// db.Insert("challenges", challenge)

	// Return the created challenge
	return challenge, nil
}
```

#### Step 4: Track User Challenge Attempts

Now, when tracking attempts for a user, we ensure that each attempt corresponds to a specific question in the challenge, and we track the language as well.

```go
// TrackUserChallenge tracks user attempts and ensures they don't exceed 3 attempts per question
func trackUserChallenge(user *User, challenge *Challenge) error {
	// Create a new UserChallenge entry
	userChallenge := &UserChallenge{
		UserID:        user.UserID,
		ChallengeID:   challenge.ChallengeID,
		QuestionsAttempted: make(map[string]int),
		Completed:     false,
		CreatedAt:     time.Now(),
	}

	// Example: Insert into database
	// db.Insert("user_challenges", userChallenge)

	return nil
}
```

### Full Example of User Challenge Flow

```go
func handleUserVisit(userID string, allQuestions []Question) {
	// Step 1: Get User Data
	user, err := getUser(userID)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error getting user:", err)
		return
	}

	// Step 2: Create Challenge for User
	challenge, err := createChallenge(user, allQuestions)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating challenge:", err)
		return
	}

	// Step 3: Store User Challenge Data
	err = trackUserChallenge(user, challenge)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error storing user challenge:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Challenge created and stored for user:", user.UserID)
}
```

### Conclusion

In this updated implementation, we have:

- **User’s Language**: We track the language a user has selected, and each challenge is created based on the user’s chosen language.
- **Challenges Based on Language**: When creating a challenge for the user, we filter available questions based on the user’s selected language.
- **Tracking Attempts**: We track user attempts for each question in a challenge and make sure that no question is repeated in future challenges for the user.

This approach ensures that the user gets challenges tailored to their selected language and keeps track of all their interactions with the platform. You can further extend this to handle additional complexities like providing language-specific hints or validating user code based on their selected language.
