About this Demo Assessment

This demo assessment gives you an idea how the assessment works, as well as showcasing the platform's ability to test an API built with .NET.
Simplified Demo Challenge Instructions

In this demo challenge, we're going to complete a PUT action for a route in a todo list API. The route is located in src/Controllers/TodoItemsController.cs at line 45. The route should update _context.TodoItems for requests with existing ids and return a 204 status, otherwise return a 404 status.
Let's get solving!

    Run the code once to see how the error messages work. Click the RUN TESTS button to see the output.
    Now let's "solve" the demo by uncommenting the solution at line 45 of src/Controllers/TodoItemsController.cs, which would normally be the code added by your developer.
    Click RUN TESTS again to see that it has passed.
    After your developer is confident in their solution, they use the SUBMIT SOLUTION button above to run the code against all the tests and produce a score.
    Now you can click REVIEW ASSESSMENT to complete the assessment and leave any comments.

    Demo Note:

    This is just a demo of the system. It shows all the test cases (you can partially or completely hide some of them for real assessments), as well as gives the solution in the answer to make it easier to preview the system.
