When deciding between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for tracking user errors and the number of submissions, consider the following:

### PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB

- **PostgreSQL**: 
  - Best for structured data with relationships and complex queries.
  - Supports ACID transactions, making it reliable for tracking state changes (like submissions).
  - SQL querying capabilities are powerful for analytics.

- **MongoDB**: 
  - Better for unstructured or semi-structured data, and flexible schema designs.
  - Ideal for rapidly changing data and when you may need to scale horizontally.
  - Good for aggregating data without complex joins.

### Recommended Choice
For tracking user errors and submissions, **PostgreSQL** is generally the better choice due to its relational nature, strong querying capabilities, and support for structured data.

### Suggested PostgreSQL Structure

You can create the following tables to track user submissions and errors effectively:

#### 1. **Users Table**

This table stores user information.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. **Questions Table**

This table stores the questions that users are attempting to solve.

```sql
CREATE TABLE questions (
    question_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    language VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3. **Submissions Table**

This table tracks each submission made by users.

```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
    submission_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question_id INT REFERENCES questions(question_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    submission_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., "Correct", "Incorrect"
    error_message TEXT, -- Any error message if the submission is incorrect
    attempt_number INT DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4. **Error Tracking Table (Optional)**

If you want a more detailed breakdown of errors, you can create a separate table for tracking errors associated with each submission.

```sql
CREATE TABLE submission_errors (
    error_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    submission_id INT REFERENCES submissions(submission_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    error_type VARCHAR(50), -- Type of error (e.g., "SyntaxError", "TypeError")
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Example Data Flow

1. **Users Table**: A new user is registered.
2. **Questions Table**: A question is added to the database.
3. **Submissions Table**: Every time a user submits an answer, an entry is made in the `submissions` table, recording the attempt, status, and any errors encountered.
4. **Error Tracking (Optional)**: If a submission is incorrect, detailed error information can be stored in the `submission_errors` table.

### Benefits of This Structure

- **Normalized Data**: Reduces redundancy and maintains data integrity.
- **Tracking Capabilities**: Easily track how many submissions a user made for a question and the errors encountered.
- **Flexible Queries**: You can perform complex queries to analyze user performance, such as finding the most common errors or average attempts per question.

### Conclusion

Using PostgreSQL for this scenario offers robust tracking of user submissions and errors with a clear, structured approach. This allows for efficient querying and data integrity, which is crucial for analyzing user performance in your code execution platform.
